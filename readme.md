# ADS Project

This project focuses on implementing and exploring algorithms, data structures, and their applications in solving computational problems. It serves as a demonstration of my work and a practical implementation hub for concepts related to computer science and software engineering.

## Features

- Implementation of various algorithms and data structures.
- Demonstrations of real-world problem-solving techniques.
- Modular and reusable code for educational and practical purposes.
- Representation of hierarchical data using a ForestTree structure.
- User-friendly application for managing accounts and transactions.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to showcase my understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as my ability to apply them in solving computational problems. A key focus of this project is the implementation of the ForestTree data structure to represent and manipulate hierarchical account data.

## Structure

The project is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific algorithm, data structure, or functionality. Each module includes:

- Code implementation.
- Comments and documentation for clarity.
- Test cases or examples for demonstration.

## Key Components

1. **Account**: Represents accounts and subaccounts with unique numbers, descriptions, balances, and associated transactions. Accounts are hierarchically related based on their numbering.
2. **Transaction**: Represents journal vouchers (JVs) with a specific subaccount, amount, and debit/credit indicator. Transactions update the balances of related accounts and subaccounts.

## Functionalities

The project includes the following functionalities:

1. Initialize an empty ForestTree.
2. Build a chart of accounts by reading data from a text file.
3. Add accounts that do not exist.
4. Add and delete transactions for accounts.
5. Generate detailed reports for accounts, including subaccounts, transactions, and balances.
6. Search for specific accounts using their numbers.
7. Print the ForestTree structure into a file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate through the modules to explore different implementations.
3. Run the code and experiment with modifications to deepen your understanding.
4. Use the provided text file to load account data into the ForestTree structure.
5. Interact with the application to manage accounts and transactions.

## Notes

This project is a personal endeavor to demonstrate my skills and understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software development. It is intended to serve as a portfolio piece and a resource for others interested in similar topics.
